            <h4 class="modal-title">COVID-19: An opportunity transforming private and public sector (27 Aug 2020)
                </h4>
            <p>Note: Published with Sanj Samachar Newspaper on 27 Aug 2020 in Gujarati language. Below is the english translation of the same.<br>
                It is eminent to understand that things will never be the same after the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been a huge damage to every single sector but this article will discuss the optimistic change which came to the private and public sector from the pandemic. Both sides of the spectrum, whether it be service provider or consumer has experienced a rapid transformation. <br> 
The biggest influence of the transformation has been through technology. Forced overnight change which companies were incapable to fully adopt from a decade has brought new advancements as well and different opportunities for the future. Overall digitisation and automation will lead the change for the next decade along with consumer demands and workers’ skill requirement changing. <br>
Under digitisation the first and foremost change would be of remote work becoming new normal. Many companies experienced the advantages of the digitisation. The huge saving on the infrastructure would be the biggest motivator for the change. Companies would start leaning towards co-working places and open meeting hubs for necessary meetings and conferences. <br>
With people working from home the factor of time has been diminishing. Employees are often working on their terms as long as they are finishing their work in a timely manner. This major change would be beneficial for companies as employees are often tend to work more hours than they were supposed to at the office. Taking in account the transportation time of each employee would be another benefit. This is also advantageous for employees as they could have better work-life balance. This would also benefit the women who often avoid working because of issues with work-life balance. This would provide them an opportunity to manage their work and life by working on their own terms. <br>
Forced digitisation also inspired immense fame to virtual meetings and emails. Fujitsu experienced zero hindrance in their day-to-day activities by going virtual and hence announced permanent work-from-home plan. The pandemic has acted as a technology equaliser by forcing employees to adapt and learn new ways of working. <br>
Another big benefit for the companies have been zero air-travel. With international borders being closed companies would save huge amount on air travel. In US in the year 2017 total business air travel account for 26% of total airline revenue which mean $292 billion. Companies would understand the benefit of avoiding air-travel and may never return to the old normal. <br>
Mandatory health screening could become the new necessity. Sectors like hospitality, healthcare and retail could make it mandatory to fight the spread. This is an optimistic development in the field of work as every employee would be screened before starting the work and overall this norm is beneficial for employees, workplaces and consumers. <br>
Pandemic has made companies desperate to cut costs and the fastest way has been accelerating automation. The lower management and mid management tedious tasks have seen rapid automation. Companies like Takeda adapting robotic process automation (RPA) to cut costs. The decade long aspiration towards manufacturing automation, drone deliveries all seems to be implemented rapidly. In mere time, the breeze of automation will have struck on majority of the companies. This would benefit private and public sector immensely to cut costs. This also mean people would have to learn new skills. The old skills would no longer be relevant. A new era of workforce skills like software skills, cyber security, data analysis and cloud computing would be necessary. <br>
Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning is likely to lead the way towards the next decade. Bain and Co recently reported that companies are planning to lean towards AI and ML by increasing their investments towards creating an advanced automated workplace. AI and ML has not yet been completely accepted as the way to the future by many companies but due to the pandemic companies are trying to conserve cash and re-evaluating their investments. <br>
Cloud technology has been around since a long time efficiently transforming supply chain, data management and employee engagement. But majority of the companies were still restrictive towards this change. The pandemic is changing our macroeconomic climate and companies are embracing cloud technologies in a faster way. Forced technological adoption has made doctors to start telehealth check-ups which was found very difficult some time ago. With changing consumer behaviour companies, must re-evaluate their business model and ways they reach customers. <br>
Consumer behaviour is also rapidly changing. The bright future of rideshare is fading in the current era. With less people preferring to stay indoors their preferences are shifting from ridesharing to food delivery. The era of face to face shopping is also diminishing. The consumer engagement has completely changed from face-to-face to virtual. From funerals to yoga classes all the services are moving virtual. <br>
These changes which are already being experienced in different scenarios around the world, will likely see a major adaption. The instantaneous change forced upon human kind could be seen as the greatest pitfall or the greatest opportunity to lead towards the agile future. <br></p>

            <h4 class="modal-title">Are people losing their trust in fiat currency?
              (4 Sep 2020)</h4>
            <p>Note: Published with Nobat Newspaper on 4 Sept 2020 in Gujarati language. This is the english translation of the same. <br>
              
              In current crisis one of the biggest threat is people losing their trust in the fiat currency. This situation can be seen in different parts of the world. When the value of the fiat currency deteriorates, people start to look for the long term stable store of value. To understand the scenario where people move to stable assets the example of Greece would be a best fit. In the year 2001 Greece adopted Euro but few years later during the 2008 financial crisis Greece suffered heavily. The situation got so dire that IMF had to rescue Greece. The people of Greece lost their faith in the Euro and accepted US dollars as it predicted long term stability. Even though USD was just as vulnerable as Euro it projected strong long term certainty. <br>
In times of crisis people tend to move away from the risky assets in search for safe havens. In COVID crisis gold and cryptocurrency is acting as the hedge. With the increasing volatility in the stock market around the world due to economic downturn investors are moving to assets acting as the stable store of value. <br>
The safe haven scenario is not gaining return on investment but acting as stable storage of value. The fluctuation in the currency in leading to a vulnerable economy. The current financial system is very fragile. In current crisis, equity is the sole for large move as market has become vulnerable. To keep the current financial system afloat government has injected huge stimulus packages. Investors have money to invest but stock market is volatile and risky. Moreover, decrease in interest rates have led investors to explore safe haven investment options. <br>
Gold is currently acting as the safe haven and there are numerous reasons. There are also major reasons for the rapid increase of its value. The lockdown situation throughout the world has affected the demand and supply of the gold. It has severely affected the gold mining around the world. Furthermore, there has been a steep decrease in the rupee value. India being second largest importer of gold certainly faces exchange rate burden. The gold price for 24 carat/10g has went from Rs 47,070 on 1st June 2020 to Rs 51,750 on 1st September 2020. This rapid increase in the price is because of people trusting gold as a safe haven. <br>
Another major store of value is cryptocurrency. With currencies becoming vulnerable and markets becoming volatile people are resorting on cryptocurrency as the future mode of store and exchange of value. The crypto spot exchange mean the platform facilitating the fiat to crypto trading. During this crisis, the spot volumes have been record high. Binance and Coinbase saw a record high daily spot volumes, as shared by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. This move indicates that people are losing their trust towards the fiat currency. Even though with high volatility the attractive points are decentralised ecosystem and cross country acceptance. Furthermore, financial institutions are now holding cryptocurrency which boosts investors’ confidence in the asset security. <br>
The COVID-19 crisis is incentivising the digital currency landscape. The Chinese central bank digital currency is soon to be launched, the world is shifting its preference towards digital cash. The bank of France is officially experimenting digital euro and South Korea’s central bank have similar plan. Blockchain technologies is revamping the remittance and provides fast and cheap cross country transfers. Cryptocurrency is becoming more and more popular day by day and in a post COVID-19 situation people might start using crypto assets in their day to day life. With current flow of increasing spot volumes and trust developing amount investors the world might change sooner than we expected. <br>
The future of the safe haven assets is bright with a high potential of price increase in both gold and cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, gold is yet to go a long way till it reaches the saturation point when the world economy starts to kick back and supply of gold starts increasing. On the other hand, cryptocurrency could face a volatile future with investors and institutions constantly disinvesting and reinvesting in cryptocurrencies but rapidly adopting in everyday transactions. Furthermore, with more institutions adopting cryptocurrency it would see a long-term increase. The trust on the fiat currency is decreasing and it will never be the same as before. Just like Venezuela economic crisis when the citizens were throwing bolivars on the street and people have still not regained their complete trust. This time the scenario is going to be with the world. <br>
